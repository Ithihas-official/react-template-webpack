This is a basic react-app template build using webpack. It provides a simple and ready-to-use setup for developing React applications with Webpack as the build tool. Whether you're new to React or looking for a minimalistic starting point, this template can help you get started quickly.

### Features

- React 18
- tailwindcss
- webpack 5
- Babel for transpiling JSX and ES6
- scss,CSS and style loading support
- eslint basic config
- Development and production build configurations

### Getting started

- #### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ithihas-official/react-template-webpack.git
```

- #### Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd react-template-webpack
```

- #### Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install #for npm
yarn install #for yarn
pnpm install #for pnpm
```

- #### Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the development server at http://localhost:8080.

Start building your React application:

You can start building your React components and application in the src directory. The entry point for your application is src/App.jsx. You can create additional components in the src/components directory.

- #### Production build:
  When you're ready to deploy your application, you can create a production build using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimizied production-ready assests in the "dist" folder.

- #### Folder Structure
